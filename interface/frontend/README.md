Which runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

A deploy of the application can be found in https://st7-project-cs.vercel.app. 

It's important to mention that as the cloud server isn't currently running, the deployed site won't get any prediction. Feel free to test the audio recording features.
